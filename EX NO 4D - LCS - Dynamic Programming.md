# EX 4D Longest Common SubSequence - Dynamic Programming.
## DATE:27/10/2025
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Constraints:

1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Algorithm

1.Read the two strings and create a DP table dp[m+1][n+1] initialized to 0.

2.Traverse both strings using two nested loops over indices i and j.

3.If characters match (text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]), set dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1.

4.Otherwise, set dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]).

5.The value dp[m][n] gives the length of the longest common subsequence.

```java

public class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {    
        int m = text1.length();
        int n = text2.length();
    
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }


    // Main method for input and output
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        String text1 = sc.nextLine().replaceAll("\"", "");
        String text2 = sc.nextLine().replaceAll("\"", "");

        int lcsLength = sol.longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2);
        System.out.println("Length of Longest Common Subsequence: " + lcsLength);

        sc.close();
    }
